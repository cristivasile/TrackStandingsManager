### Summary
TSM is used for creating and managing vehicular leaderboards. How is it different from most leaderboard apps? The main focus of this app is comparing the vehicles rather than the authors of the times. You can filter leaderboards by car brands and categories (ex: show only sedans), or list all the vehicles and sort them by the average positions inside the competitions. 

### Supported Platforms
This app will only run on Desktop PCs running a Microsoft Windows version compatible with .NET 8.
